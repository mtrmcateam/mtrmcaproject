      <p><b>Mycollegeadda.com</b> is an online platform to college students to share and sell their used stuff with their college-mates. Sellers can post free advertisement on mycollegeadda.com and Buyers can search for things they need. The transaction between seller and buyer gets completed within college campus, thereby providing convenience to all and leaving both parties better off after the transaction.

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
      Contribute to make a difference, in any possible way we can – was our motive. Then why not start with people around us with whom we would like to connect, develop friendship and spend quality time – Our Colleagues – Our College mates.
      </p>
      <p>
      With this came an idea to create a place, a Adda where all college students can meet and come forward to help each other and in process generate value. This is how Mycollegeadda.com was born. We created it as a marketplace where students can post about things or information they think can benefit others.
      </p>
      <p>
      Posting Used Books, Notes, Electronics, Carpool Rides and Flatmates on mycollegeadda.com is a first step in this direction. Students having used books, notes or electronics to sell, can post so that students within same college or city requiring same can contact them directly, thereby saving on the money.

      <p>
      In addition to this students who are commuting by car or bikes or public transport can find great partners to share the cost by posting their ad under Carpool. One can also find flat or flatmates on this site under Flat/Flatmates category.

      We are soon going to add other functionalities in mycollegeadda.com which will add further to your experience of being at Adda. Stay connected…

      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
